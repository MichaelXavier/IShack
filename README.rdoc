= IShack
A utility for uploading images to the ImageShack hosting service. ishack --help for usage.

Currently, the application works but the specs aren't passing and I don't have much time to fix them.

= TODO
1. Get specs working
2. Fix crappy output formatting
3. Support STDIN uploading mode
4. Per-file progress bar
